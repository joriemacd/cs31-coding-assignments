    "* Your code takes input the two numbers in decimal notation instead of the binary notation. DONE\n",
    "* You are going to calculate your “running time” as follows: any time your code adds or subtracts two numbers a and b, it costs max(Na, Nb) where Na and Nb are the number of digits in a and b.\n",
    "* However, when an even number is incremented by 1, in that case the “running time” is only 1 (even if the even number has many digits).\n",
    "* Multiplying by 2, or dividing by 2 and taking floors, is not to be counted in your “running time”.\n",

    "To give an example, if we call DIVIDE(5, 2) it calls DIVIDE(2, 2) which returns (1, 0), which becomes (2,0) in the call of DIVIDE, and since 5 is odd, we increment it to (2,1). The final increment step costs 1-unit, and this is the total time. As another example, if you call DIVIDE(21, 15) it calls DIVIDE (10, 15) which returns (0, 10); this becomes (0, 20) upon doubling, and since 21 is odd, we increment it to (0, 21). This increment costs 1 unit. 21 > 15, thus, we subtract 21 − 15 to get 6. This subtraction costs 2 units since both 21 and 15 are 2 digits. And, the quotient is incremented, and this costs another 1 unit of time. Thus, the final answer is (1, 6) and the total time is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 units.\n",

For this, we suggest you import time and then time.time() returns the time past since a certain fixed point of time (Google this to find more).
