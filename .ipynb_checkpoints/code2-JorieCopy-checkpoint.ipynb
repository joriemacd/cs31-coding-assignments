    "In this coding assignment, the inputs will be polynomials. As done in class, a degree n polynomial p(x) = p0 + p1x + p2x2 + ··· + pnxn is represented as an array P[0 : n] where P[i] contains the coefficient pi. The input to the functions you write should be two lists P [0 : n] and Q[0 : n], and the output should be R[0 : 2n] which contains the coefficients of the polynomial r(x) = p(x)q(x)."
