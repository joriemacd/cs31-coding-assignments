    "To give an example, if we call DIVIDE(5, 2) it calls DIVIDE(2, 2) which returns (1, 0), which becomes (2,0) in the call of DIVIDE, and since 5 is odd, we increment it to (2,1). The final increment step costs 1-unit, and this is the total time. As another example, if you call DIVIDE(21, 15) it calls DIVIDE (10, 15) which returns (0, 10); this becomes (0, 20) upon doubling, and since 21 is odd, we increment it to (0, 21). This increment costs 1 unit. 21 > 15, thus, we subtract 21 − 15 to get 6. This subtraction costs 2 units since both 21 and 15 are 2 digits. And, the quotient is incremented, and this costs another 1 unit of time. Thus, the final answer is (1, 6) and the total time is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 units.\n",

For this assignment, we are asking you to measure actual running time of your machine. For this, we suggest you import time and then time.time() returns the time past since a certain fixed point of time (Google this to find more). More importantly, taking a difference between two snapshots, one before a run of a function and one after, gives you a very good estimate of how long (in seconds) the function took.\n",
